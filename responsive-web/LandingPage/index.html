                a fighter—he was a force of nature. His speed defied cameras, his power shattered limits, and his
                philosophy reshaped martial arts forever. A man who moved like water, struck like lightning, and left
                behind a legacy that still roars like a dragon. Fearless. Unstoppable. Legendary</figcaption>

                <ul>
                    <li>Bruce Lee's punches and kicks were so fast that filmmakers had to slow down his fight scenes so
                        audiences could actually see them!</li>
                    <li>He founded Jeet Kune Do (The Way of the Intercepting Fist)—a revolutionary, fluid martial art
                        that focused on adaptability and efficiency, breaking traditional martial arts rules.</li>
                    <li>His famous one-inch punch was so powerful that it could knock a man off his feet with almost no
                        wind-up.</li>
                    <li>Bruce Lee wasn't just about fighting—he studied philosophy at the University of Washington and
                        wrote deep insights about life, discipline, and self-improvement.</li>
                    <li>Before Bruce Lee, Hollywood rarely cast Asian actors in strong leading roles. His impact broke
                        racial barriers and inspired future martial arts icons like Jackie Chan and Jet Li.</li>
